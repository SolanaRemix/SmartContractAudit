# Sponsorship Tiers

## Overview

Financial sponsorship helps sustain CyberAi development, infrastructure, and community. We offer multiple tiers to accommodate different levels of support.

## Important Notes

- **Independence**: Sponsorship does NOT grant control over project decisions
- **Transparency**: All sponsors publicly listed
- **Community First**: Open source community remains our priority
- **Tax**: We are not currently a registered non-profit; consult your tax advisor

See [GOVERNANCE.md](/GOVERNANCE.md) for sponsor influence policy.
