## Best Practices

### For Partners

**Secure Integration**:
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Secure credential storage
const apiKey = process.env.SCA_API_KEY;

// ❌ Bad: Hardcoded credentials
const apiKey = "sca_live_xxxx";
```

**Data Minimization**:
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Request only needed data
const result = await client.scan({
  repository: 'owner/repo',
  fields: ['summary', 'critical_findings']
});

// ❌ Bad: Request everything
const result = await client.scan({
  repository: 'owner/repo',
  fields: ['*']
});
```

**User Consent**:
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Check consent before scanning
if (user.hasConsentedToScan()) {
  await client.scan(config);
}

// ❌ Bad: Scan without consent
await client.scan(config);
```

## Privacy by Design

We build privacy into our products:

- **Data Minimization**: Collect only what's needed
- **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated purpose
- **Storage Limitation**: Delete when no longer needed
- **Access Controls**: Restrict access to authorized users
- **Encryption**: Protect data at rest and in transit
- **Transparency**: Clear privacy policies
- **User Control**: Easy access to privacy settings

## Subprocessors

We use these subprocessors:

| Service | Purpose | Location |
