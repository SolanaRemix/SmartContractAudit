## Decision-Making Model

### Consensus-Seeking

We strive for consensus on major decisions through open discussion:

1. **Proposal**: Anyone can propose changes via issues or discussions
2. **Discussion**: Community members provide feedback and alternatives
3. **Refinement**: Proposal is refined based on feedback
4. **Consensus**: Maintainers seek general agreement
5. **Implementation**: Approved changes are implemented

### Voting (When Consensus Fails)

If consensus cannot be reached, maintainers vote:

- Simple majority (>50%) for routine decisions
- Supermajority (>66%) for major changes:
  - License changes
  - Governance changes
  - Project scope changes
  - Major architectural decisions

### Maintainer Decision Authority

For day-to-day operations, maintainers have authority to:

- Merge pull requests meeting quality standards
- Triage and label issues
- Release minor and patch versions
- Enforce Code of Conduct
- Make tactical implementation decisions

## Release Process

### Version Scheme

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Release Schedule

- **Major releases**: Planned annually (e.g., v2026.01.01)
- **Minor releases**: Quarterly or as needed
- **Patch releases**: As needed for bugs and security
- **Security releases**: Immediately upon fix availability

### Release Checklist
