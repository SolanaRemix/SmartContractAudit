# TRIO Pillars

The CuberAi project is built on three foundational pillars:

- **Product**: A comprehensive AI-powered smart contract audit system with on-chain automation
- **Governance**: Community-driven decision-making and transparent development processes
- **Security**: Rigorous vulnerability assessment, secure coding practices, and proactive threat mitigation

This SmartContractAudit repository serves as a focused tool for contract auditing and security automation.
